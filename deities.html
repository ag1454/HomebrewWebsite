            <p>
                Ha’almehen is an ancient water elemental from the Plane of Water. Though it
                primarily resides there, it is not uncommon for it to cross into the Material
                Plane and watch over its waters. Centuries of its visitations have resulted in it
                being regarded as a sea god known as Sedsed, though it possesses no clerics. It
                also has no warlocks. Ha’almehen is very secretive and rarely makes appearances
                to mortals; if it does appear, it is reported it appears as a leviathan. Ha’almehen
                is part of a group of elementals who wish to prevent The Bridge from ravaging the
                Material Plane and undoing its natural balance.

            <h2 id="ilican">Ilican</h1>
            <p>
                An alien entity from the Far Realm also known as The Bridge, it presents itself
                as an angelic and caring being on the Material Plane. In reality, Ilican is
                destructive, enjoys driving its followers to commit heinous deeds in the name
                of “worship,” and desires to have as many realities as it can under its
                influence.

            <h2 id="irune">Irune</h1>
            <p>
                Worshiped by nearly all people of Irunia for thousands of years, she is regarded as
                the embodiment of all things good and viewed as a protector goddess. Irune sealed
                Vahagn away thousands of years ago, but was split into three separate beings when
                it resurfaced.

            <h2 id="mercy">Mercy</h1>
            <p>
                Also known as The Overseer, Mercy is a mysterious deity with unknown origins. His
                doctrine centers on blood’s power as a natural life force within all who possess it,
                the balance of life and death, and sacrifice. He developed the magic of hemocraft.
                It is said he once created a whole universe from a single drop of his own blood.
                Those who worship him are not deterred by his aloof and cryptic nature. It is not
                uncommon for vampires to have their weddings officiated under a priest or cleric of
                Mercy.

            <h2 id="mauknave">Mauknave</h1>
            <p>
                Mauknave is a hedonistic being who lost his position as a god due to his less than
                desirable behavior, but still retains many of his godlike powers. He harbors souls
                in his body, a terrifying creation that resembles a jabberwock. His selfish nature
                has diminished greatly since he has been reunited with his lover, a saint of his
                brother-god. The stories that were initially told of a raging god quelled by a
                revived saint turned into the stories of a love between a reformed monster and the
                only one who was not frightened by him.

            <h2 id="nivensolem">Nivensolem</h1>
            <p>
                A tender and merciful god who primarily takes the form of a growing tree that
                resembles a human man, symbolic of his position as the god who bestows life upon
                all creatures. Nivensolem follows the rules of his fellow gods, but is charismatic
                enough to sway their opinions in his favor if necessary. He desires nothing but the
                best for his followers, deeply devoted to every one of them. He is “brother” to the
                god of souls, Mauknave.

            <p>
                An ancient and chaotic force, Irune sealed it thousands of years ago after it
                attempted to consume the land and its people. Vahagn was able to resurface and
                split Irune into three beings. However, the three beings had enough combined power
                to confine Vahagn in Irune’s royal castle.
